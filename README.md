# WikiMirror

This extension allows for mirroring and forking pages from a remote wiki.
At this time, a number of configuration considerations must be made for this to work:

- Namespaces must match exactly between the local and remote wikis.
- The remote wiki API must be accessible.

Further documentation will be written as this extension gets closer to release.
